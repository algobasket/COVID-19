# CoronaVirus(COVID-19) Framework

## Brief Information on COVID19

This API provides updated real-time data on coronavirus cases from the worldometers page and other important websites, provided by the most reputable organizations and statistical offices in the world.

**This is pre-release code and can be use to analyse data.**

More information about the data for this version can be found in [the announcement](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on this official site.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://covid-19.github.io/userguide/). 


## üö® Important Information üö®  

If you notice that I make and publish many updates / versions in the api, it is due to all the data that is reaching the public. This helps me create a more complete API, with accurate data.

In turn, I have created a website to demonstrate the capabilities that this API has when using it to create web applications. I have only created it for demonstration, so it will serve as a prototype.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how COVID-19 framework works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!
